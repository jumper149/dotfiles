this file does nothing :)


'ext_gamma_from_time_blank' works like this:
TIME[min] GAMMA

the data in 'ext_gamma_from_time_blank' is supposed to give sample times for the gamma values


'gamma_calculator.py' creates gamma_from_mins_blank


'gamma_control.sh' changes gamma-level with 'xgamma' depending of time 'date'


the folder 'blugon' is located in:
'~/.config/i3/scripts/blugon/'

when this folder is moved 'gamma_calculator.py', 'blugon.sh'  and 'gamma_control.sh' need to be edited


'blugon.sh' is starting 'gamma_control.sh' every few minutes and can be used with autostart
